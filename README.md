# Mythologist

A web application to make narrative focused, high-prep online TTRPG games delightful.

Built with Blazor with an azure backend, containing both a gameplay application for players, as well as a CRUD application for GM's to manage their compaigns.
Also integrates with discord to allow playing from inside a discord call.
90% done, 90% away from being done.
